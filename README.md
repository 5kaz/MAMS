# MAMS
Multi-agent meeting scheduling, a JADE artificial intelligence project.

# Usage

- `ant compile` to build the project
- `ant run` to run the project

## TODO 
- Fix concurrency potential issues
- Send the meeting request only to a specific subset of all agents (contact list)
- When a meeting is scheduled, add the slot to a list of meetings and remove it from the available slots.
- Make the meeting visible on UI
(OPTIONAL)
- Add the possibility to manually change the values of the calendar from UI
